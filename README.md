# Surfingkeys - Expand your browser with javascript and keyboard.

Surfingkeys is another Chrome/Firefox extension that provides keyboard-based navigation and control of the web in the spirit of the VIM editor. But it's not for VIM users only, it's for anyone who just needs some more shortcuts to his own functions.

Surfingkeys is created with all settings described in Javascript, so it's easy for anyone to map any keystrokes to his own defined Javascript function. For example,

    mapkey('<Ctrl-y>', 'Show me the money', function() {
        Front.showPopup('a well-known phrase uttered by characters in the 1996 film Jerry Maguire (Escape to close).');
    });

Surfingkeys works for Firefox(above 57) since 0.9.15, with below features as exceptions:

* Sync settings across devices for same account
* Proxy settings
* Markdown preview

## Quick start

After you install the extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/surfingkeys/gfbliohnnapiefjpjlpjnehglfpaknnc) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/surfingkeys_ff/), open a site you'd like. Then press `?` or `u` to take a quick look on the default mappings first. Press `Esc` to hide the usage popover.

Try some mappings described in the usage popover. For example, press `e` to scroll a page up, `d` to scroll a page down, `se` to open settings page.

* `?` to show help
![help](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/16181995/1417ca44-36d4-11e6-96c9-9e84b33f0916.png)
* `t` to search bookmarks/history
![urls](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/16182031/58e15ec4-36d4-11e6-9cc5-ff35970df25f.png)
* `/` to find in current page
![find](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/16182044/65f4713c-36d4-11e6-9e21-6b61a858f080.png)
* `f` to follow links
![follow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/16182118/18d27678-36d5-11e6-9759-d8b5ff49930c.png)
* `v` to toggle visual mode
![visual](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/16182120/1cc536da-36d5-11e6-9e08-293cdb8fbcd2.png)
* `T` to switch tabs
![tabs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/10328839/f0143ffe-6ceb-11e5-8eee-962db94b2c22.png)

## Follow links

Default hint characters for links are `asdfgqwertzxcvb`, it quits when a non-hint key is pressed. Add below line to your settings to make it right hand:

    Hints.characters = 'yuiophjklnm'; // for right hand

When hints are overlapped, press `Shift` to flip them. Hold `space` to hold hints temporarily, release `space` to restore hints.

Hints are placed in center of target links, you could add below line in your settings to let them aligned left.

    settings.hintAlign = "left";

## Surfingkeys modes

There are three modes in Surfingkeys: normal, visual and insert.

### Normal mode, the default mode.

When you open a page, it enters normal mode automatically. All mappings added with `mapkey` work in this mode.

### Visual mode, the mode for text selection, and actions on the selected text.

Press `v` to toggle visual mode. You'll see an indicator at bottom of current page - `Caret` or `Range`, and a large cursor on page. The cursor is made large for visibility, as sometimes it's not easy for human to locate a normal cursor on a web page.

`Caret` indicates that cursor is moved when you press jkhl, `Range` indicates that you'll select text when moving cursor.

Now here is a small practice,

1. press `v` you'll see `Caret`
1. use the VIM key bindings to move cursor to some where.
1. press `v` again, you'll see `Range`.
1. use the VIM key bindings to select some text.
1. press `sg` to see what will happen.
1. press `v` again to back to normal mode.

All mappings added with `vmapkey` work in this mode, with some built-in mappings like those in VIM - `j` `k` `h` `l` `b` `w``0` `$` etc.

![search_selected](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644215/759f1e70-61b3-11e6-8bf8-0bdff7d0c933.gif)

* `zz` make cursor at center of window.
* `f` forward to next char.
* `F` backward to next char.
* `;` repeat latest f, F.
* `,` repeat latest f, F in opposite direction.

### Insert mode

When focus is switched into any editable element by whatever means(`i` hints or `f` hints or mouse click), Insert mode is on.

All mappings added with `imapkey` work in this mode.

* `Ctrl - i` to open vim editor to edit.
* `Ctrl - '` to toggle quotes in an input element, this is useful for search engines like google.
* `Ctrl-e` move the cursor to the end of the line.
* `Ctrl-f` move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
* `Ctrl-u` delete all entered characters before the cursor.
* `Alt-b` move the cursor Backward 1 word.
* `Alt-f` move the cursor Forward 1 word.
* `Alt-w` delete a word backwards.
* `Alt-d` delete a word forwards.

`imap` and `iunmap` for insert mode.

    imap(',,', "<Esc>");        // press comma twice to leave current input box.
    imap(';;', "<Ctrl-'>");     // press semicolon twice to toggle quote.

#### Emoji completion

When user inputs a colon and 2(set by `settings.startToShowEmoji`) characters such as `:gr` in insert mode, Surfingkeys will try to find matched emoji, and list them out if there are some found.

![emoji](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/23602453/924ed762-028b-11e7-86f3-bf315c0a2499.gif)

If you want this feature disabled completely, use below settings:

    iunmap(":");

If you'd like emoji suggestions popup as soon as you input colon, use below:

    settings.startToShowEmoji = 0;

[Complete list of Emoji](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/blob/master/pages/emoji.tsv)

### Find

`Find` is not actually a mode, it just another way to enter visual mode. Press `/` to open find bar, which sits at almost the same position with Mode indicator, type something there. All occurrences of your input will be highlighted. Press `Enter` to finish the finding, and you're in `Caret` visual mode now, press `n` to find next, `N` to find previous.

Press `Ctrl-Enter` to find exactly the whole word input, like with the input `\bkeyword\b`.

### PassThrough mode

To press `Alt-i` to enter PassThrough mode gives you a chance to temporarily suppress SurfingKeys, which means Surfingkeys will not care any key press until leaving this mode by pressing `Esc`. In this mode, you could use built-in shortcuts from any site itself. Please see [Feature Request: implement Vimium-style insert mode Â· Issue #656](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/issues/656) for why we brought this in and the difference between `Alt-i` and `Alt-s`.

## Omnibar

The omnibar provides kinds of functions that need user input, for example,

* Open url(from both bookmarks and history) with `t`
* Open bookmarks with `b`
* Open search engines with `og` / `ow` ...
* Open commands with `:`

### key bindings in Omnibar
* `Enter` to open selected item and close omnibar.
* `Ctrl-Enter` to open selected item, but keep omnibar open for more items to be opened.
* `Shift-Enter` to open selected item in current tab and close omnibar. If you'd like to open in current tab by default, please use `go`.
* `Tab` to forward cycle through the candidates.
* `Shift-Tab` to backward cycle through the candidates.
* `Ctrl-.` to show results of next page
* `Ctrl-,` to show results of previous page
* `Ctrl-c` to copy all listed items

In omnibar opened with `t`:

`Ctrl - d` to delete from bookmark or history

In omnibar opened with `b`:

`Ctrl - Shift - <any letter>` to create vim-like global mark

![search_engine](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644214/759ef1d4-61b3-11e6-9bd9-70c38c8b80e0.gif)

`cmap` could be used for Omnibar to change mappings, for example:

    cmap('<Ctrl-n>', '<Tab>');
    cmap('<Ctrl-p>', '<Shift-Tab>');

## Search selected with

My favorite feature from when I was using Firefox. For both Firefox and Chrome, the extensions make it through context menu. Surfingkeys makes it through key mappings. By default, when you press `sg` in normal mode, it will search selected text with google, if there is none selected, it will search text from system clipboard with google. In visual mode, it will search selected text with google.

The `g` in `sg` is a search alias for google, there are some other built-in search aliases -- like `w` for bing. So press `sw` to search selected with bing. Refer to [Add search alias to omnibar](#add-search-alias-to-omnibar) to add your own search alias, especially those search engines for company inside.

Besides that, there is a `sog`, to search selected text only in this site with google. For `sog`, `s` is the search_leader_key, `o` is the only_this_site_key, `g` is the search alias.

The search_leader_key `s` plus capital alias `G` will search selected with google interactively, all other search aliases and those you added through API `addSearchAliasX` work in same way.

## Vim-like marks

You can create vim-like marks by pressing `m`, followed by a word character(a-z for local marks, others like 0-9 / A-Z for global marks), used as mark name. For example, if you press `ma` on this page, you'll create a mark named `a` which points to this page. Then pressing `'a` anywhere, you'll jump to this page.

In this way, the created mark always points to current URL. You can also create vim-like marks from the bookmarks. Try following steps:

1. press `b` to open bookmarks.
1. type something to locate the URL you'd like to create vim-like mark for.
1. press Ctrl, plus a mark name, such as `f`.

Then afterwards `'F` will open that URL directly.

This is very useful for those pages you access very frequently. `om` to check out all the vim-like marks you have created.

## Switch tabs

By default, pressing `T` will show all opened tabs in an overlay, then pressing the hint char, will switch to the related tab.

![tabs_overlay](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/10544636/245447f6-7457-11e5-8372-62b8f6337158.png)

There is `settings.tabsThreshold` here. When total of opened tabs exceeds `settings.tabsThreshold`(default as 9), omnibar will be used for choosing tabs.

![tabs_omnibar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/10544630/1fbdd02c-7457-11e5-823c-14411311c315.png)

If you prefer to use omnibar always, use below mapping:

    mapkey('<Space>', 'Choose a tab with omnibar', function() {
        Front.openOmnibar({type: "Tabs"});
    });

which works same as:

    settings.tabsThreshold = 0;

The tabs are displayed in MRU order by default, either in omnibar or overlay. If you want them in natural order, use:

    settings.tabsMRUOrder = false;

## Commands

`:` to open omnibar for commands, then you can execute any pre-defined there. The result will be displayed below the omnibar.

    // create shortcuts for the command with different parameters
    map('spa', ':setProxyMode always');
    map('spb', ':setProxyMode byhost');
    map('spd', ':setProxyMode direct');

Besides commands, you can also run javascript code.

![commands_in_omnibar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/11527801/fadee82c-991d-11e5-92e9-b054796a6a75.png)

## Smooth scroll

Smooth scroll works for any scrollable element. It is on by default, to turn it off as below:

    settings.smoothScroll = false;

`j`/`k` scrolls in one step with size as 70, you could change it as below:

    settings.scrollStepSize = 140;

## Session management

To create session in Chrome with Surfingkeys will save URLs for all tabs, and to open a session will open all the URLs of the session in different tab, so basically a session is a list of URLs, which has a name.

* `ZZ` will save all current tabs into a session named `LAST` then quit.
* `ZR` will restore the session named `LAST`.
* `ZQ` will just quit.

You can create multiple sessions with different names in command mode. Press `:` to open omnibar for commands, then input:

    createSession works

Surfingkeys will create a session named `works` for you, to open the session with command input as:

    openSession works

To list all your saved sessions:

    listSession

To delete a session:

    deleteSession works

## Repeats action by pressing number before mapkey

If you need repeat some action several times, just press a number before mapkey, such as `3d`, which will scroll down 3 pages. Repeats also works for Tab navigation, for example, you're now on the 1st Tab, and you want to switch to the 4th Tab,

* press `3R` to achieve that
* `3E` will switch back to 1st Tab.

Another example to move one Tab, say, you're on the 12th Tab of 23 tabs.

* `11<<` will move current tab to beginning.
* `10>>` will move current tab to end.

Usually, you need not count the number, you just prefix a large number such as `99<<`, if you want to move a tab to beginning or end.

## Hotkey to toggle Surfingkeys

By default, `Alt-s` will toggle Surfingkeys for current site. When Surfingkeys is turned off, all mappings stop working except the hotkey. To change hotkey, use settings below:

    map('<Ctrl-i>', '<Alt-s>'); // hotkey must be one keystroke with/without modifier, it can not be a sequence of keystrokes like `gg`.

When Surfingkeys is turned off on some site by `Alt-s`, the status will be persisted in settings, for example,

    "blacklist": {
        "https://github.com": 1
    },

`Alt-s` once more will remove it from settings.blacklist. The data settings are not always presented in snippets, you could use `yj` to dump all settings into clipboard, then paste it in your text editor to check out.

Another way to disable Surfingkeys is to use `settings.blacklistPattern`, please refer to [regex for disabling](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/issues/63).

## Proxy settings

SwitchySharp is a great extension to switch proxy, but my use case with it is very simple,

1. create a profile using PAC script.
1. maintain site list in the PAC script, use proxy if the site being accessed is in the list.
1. whenever I come into a site blocked by something, I add it to the list in PAC script.
1. click the SwitchySharp icon to reload the profile.
1. casually I click the SwitchySharp icon to switch profile between `direct` and `pac_script`.

To avoid manually editing PAC script and reloading/switching profile by clicking SwitchySharp icon, I replaced SwitchySharp by integrating proxy settings into Surfingkeys, and provides related commands and shortcuts.

* setProxy, to set proxy, some examples:

        setProxy 192.168.1.100:8080
        setProxy 127.0.0.1:1080 SOCKS5

* setProxyMode, to set proxy mode, there are five modes: direct, byhost, bypass, always, system and clear.

        direct      Chrome will connect to all sites directly.
        byhost      Chrome will only connect to sites added by `addProxySite` through related proxy. You could add multiple pairs of `proxy` and `hosts`, for hosts matched with `hosts` `proxy` will be used.
        bypass      Chrome will connect to all sites through proxy, with specified hosts excluded.
        always      Chrome will connect to all sites through proxy.
        system      Use proxy configuration taken from the operating system.
        clear       Surfingkeys will not take control of proxy settings, this is the default mode.

* addProxySite, removeProxySite, toggleProxySite, to make Chrome connect to site through proxy or not, examples:

        addProxySite google.com,facebook.com,twitter.com

* proxyInfo, to list proxy you set by `setProxy`, proxy mode you set by `setProxyMode` and sites you add/remove by `addProxySite`/`removeProxySite`/`toggleProxySite`.

* `cp`, toggle proxy for current site.

* `spa`, shortcut for `:setProxyMode always`

* `spb`, shortcut for `:setProxyMode byhost`

* `spc`, shortcut for `:setProxyMode clear`

* `spd`, shortcut for `:setProxyMode direct`

* `sps`, shortcut for `:setProxyMode system`

* `spi`, shortcut for `:proxyInfo`

## VIM editor and Emacs editor

Thanks ACE for the vim editor, Surfingkeys integrates ACE for the vim editor. The vim editor is used:

* to edit any input on html page
* to edit URL to open in new tab
* to edit settings

You could change to Emacs keybindings for the editor by adding below settings:

    settings.aceKeybindings = "emacs";

With Emacs keybindings, use `C-x C-s` to save your input.

### Edit any input on html page

In normal mode, press capital `I`, then use a hint letter to pick up a input box. A vim editor is opened for you to edit text. The vim editor is opened in slightly different way for `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` elements.

For `<input>` elements, the vim editor has only one line, and you use vim key bindings to edit your text. Then press `Enter` or `:w` to write your text back to the `<input>` element.

![input_with_vim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644219/75a72b2e-61b3-11e6-8ce2-06c9cc94aeca.gif)

For `<textarea>` elements, the vim editor is opened in bigger size. After you complete your edits, press `Ctrl-Enter` or `:w` to write your text back to the `<textarea>` element.

![textarea_with_vim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644217/75a27e44-61b3-11e6-8f21-9cd79d3c5776.gif)

For `<select>` elements, the vim editor is again opened in bigger size. Instead of editing the text, search for the desired option and jump to the line, then press `Enter` to select it. This is handy for `<select>` elements which have lots of options.

![select_with_vim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644218/75a458a4-61b3-11e6-8ce7-eedcc996745c.gif)

`Esc` or `:q` to quit vim editor without writing text back.

`Tab` completion works with all words on current page, `Space` to choose a match from popup.

If you enter insert mode with `i` or mouse click, you will edit your input in normal way. You could also open vim editor at that time by pressing `Ctrl-i`.

Remember that in insert mode, press `Ctrl-i` to open the vim editor.

### Edit URL to open in new tab

`su` to open vim editor to edit current URL, then `Enter` or `:w` to open the input URL, which works just like address bar with vim-binding keys.

`Tab` completion works with all URLs from bookmark/history, `Space` to choose a match from popup.

![url_with_vim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644220/75f8eedc-61b3-11e6-9630-da2250ac5f10.gif)

### Edit settings

`se` to open settings editor, `:w` to save settings.

## Dot to repeat previous action

[Repeating previous actions](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/issues/67)

All keystrokes in normal mode are repeatable by dot, except those keystrokes mapped with `repeatIgnore` as `true`, for example,

    mapkey('e', '#2Scroll a page up', function() {
        Normal.scroll("pageUp");
    }, {repeatIgnore: true});

Then `.` will not repeat action to page up, even `e` is just pressed.

## Markdown preview

1. copy your markdown source into clipboard.
1. `sm` to open markdown preview, which will preview markdown from clipboard.
1. Then on the preview page, another `sm` will open vim editor to edit markdown source.
1. `:wq` to refresh preview.
1. `r` to reload markdown source from clipboard.

![markdown](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17669897/0b6fbaf6-6342-11e6-8583-86eb8691190d.gif)

By default, Surfingkeys uses this [markdown parser](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to preview markdown, if you'd like to use [github markdown API](https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/) to parse your markdown, please add below line to your settings:

    settings.useLocalMarkdownAPI = false;

## Capture page

There are some circumstances that you want to take a screenshot on a page, below shortcuts could help you, especially when it is for a long page or just for some scrollable DIV on the page.

* `yg` to capture current page.
* `yG` to capture current full page if it is scrollable.
* `yS` to capture current scroll target.

After one of above shortcuts pressed, you could see a popup of captured image, on which you could then right click with a MOUSE( ð¢ ) to save as or copy into system clipboard.

## Mermaid diagram generator

[Mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) is a great tool to generate diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.
Surfingkeys provides a simple frontend to generate diagrams from text in clipboard, and a vim editor to edit it.

`Ctrl-Alt-d` to open it.

## PDF viewer
To make Surfingkeys work for PDF files, Surfingkeys integrates PDF viewer from the notable [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js). When a pdf file is opened in Chrome, the PDF viewer will be launched, and you could use everything from Surfingkeys then.

If you would like to use original pdf viewer provided by Chrome itself, use `;s` to toggle that.

Some functionalities are also available when you're using original pdf viewer, but some functionalities such as smooth scroll/visual mode etc won't be available.

## Edit your own settings

    addSearchAlias(alias, prompt, search_url, suggestion_url, callback_to_parse_suggestion);

| parameter  | explanation |
|:---------------| :-----|
|**alias**                                   | one or several chars, used as search alias. When you input the string and press `space` in omnibar, it will switch to the related search engine.|
|**prompt**                                  | a string to tell you which search engine will be used for following search|
|**search_url**                              | the URL for the search engine|
|**suggestion_url[optional]**                | omnibar will list out search suggestions from the engine, if you provide suggestion_url and callback_to_parse_suggestion|
|**callback_to_parse_suggestion[optional]**  | works with suggestion_url to provide search suggestion|

    addSearchAliasX(alias, prompt, search_url, search_leader_key, suggestion_url, callback_to_parse_suggestion, only_this_site_key);

| parameter  | explanation |
|:---------------| :-----|
|**search_leader_key**                                   | one or several chars, used as search leader key, in case of that you would not like to use the default key `s`.|
|**only_this_site_key**                                  | one or several chars, used as only-this-site-key, in case of that you would not like to use the default key `o`.|

This version will create a mapping to search selected text with `search_url` on pressing `search_leader_key` followed by `alias`, except that it adds search alias to omnibar as the normal version. For example, below line

    addSearchAliasX('s', 'stackoverflow', 'http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=', 'o');

works like

    addSearchAlias('s', 'stackoverflow', 'http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=');
    mapkey('os', 'Search Selected with stackoverflow', function() {
        searchSelectedWith("http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=");
    });
    vmapkey('os', 'Search Selected with stackoverflow', function() {
        searchSelectedWith("http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=");
    });

### remove search alias and its bindings

    removeSearchAliasX(alias, search_leader_key, only_this_site_key);

### Omnibar helpers

    Omnibar.listWords(<array of words>)
    Omnibar.html(<any html snippets>)

### Styling

To change style for link hints:

    Hints.style('border: solid 3px #552a48; color:#efe1eb; background: initial; background-color: #552a48;');

To Change style for text hints:

    Hints.style("border: solid 8px #C38A22;padding: 1px;background: #e39913", "text");

Change the style of the search marks and cursor:

    Visual.style('marks', 'background-color: #89a1e2;');
    Visual.style('cursor', 'background-color: #9065b7;');

### Create mapping in vim editor

    aceVimMap(lhs, rhs, ctx)

For example,

    aceVimMap('jk', '<Esc>', 'insert');
